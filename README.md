# Deal-Finder

## Description

This application searches for a product that a user specifies and finds the
lowest price of that product if it was found.
Currently, the app will be limited to Walmart.com and Amazon.com, but I plan to
expand the number of online retailers in future versions.

## Usage

When the app is run, the user will be prompted to enter a product to search for.
After the user enters a product they want to search for, the app will search
various online retailers to find the cheapest price for the product and then
display a message containing the result. If the productcould not be found, the
app will notify the user and let them search for another product. When the user
is done searching for products, they can exit the app by typing "exit" in the
search prompt.
